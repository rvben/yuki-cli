# yuki-client

Typed async client for the [Yuki](https://www.yukiworks.nl/) bookkeeping SOAP API.

This crate is the transport and parsing layer extracted from
[`yuki-cli`](https://github.com/rvben/yuki-cli): SOAP envelope building,
key-based authentication, and typed wrappers over the Accounting, AccountingInfo,
Sales, VAT, Contact, and Archive services. The CLI is a thin presentation layer
on top; other consumers (such as a long-running service) can depend on this crate
directly.

## HTTP client

`SoapClient::new` builds its own `reqwest::Client`, which is convenient for
short-lived processes. Long-running consumers should pass a shared, pooled client
via `SoapClient::with_client` (and the matching `XClient::with_client`
constructors) so connections are reused across requests.

## Yuki API notes

- SOAP namespace: `http://www.theyukicompany.com/`
- Flow is always `authenticate()` -> `set_current_domain()` -> operation calls.
- SOAP faults are returned as HTTP 500; the body is parsed for the fault.
- Sessions expire quickly, so each run authenticates fresh.
